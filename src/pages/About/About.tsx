          I was born in January 1990. After getting my Degree in computer
          science in 2002, I persuaded my higher study in Human Computer
          Interaction Design. I got my first job as Graphic Designer in the year
          2008. After getting experience in graphic for a year, I moved to UI-UX
          Designing.

          In 2010, I decided to work as a Freelance Web, UI-UX & Mobile
          Interface Designer. I find myself still in the learning phase and have
          strong desire to achieve as many skills as I can.
